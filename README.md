# Leaflet-Challenge


To Do's:
- add tectonic plate info

10/13:
- Changed markers to circles; size and opacity correspond to magnitude and depth
- Added data labels


10/12:
- Pulled JSON object and reviewed format; pulling coordinate info; working with simple monthly file with only 6 datapoints
- Created base map
- Created overlay map
- Changed html id of map from "mapid" to "map" in order for map object to load; division reference was correct but map wouldn't load with id of "mapid"
- Correcting location data; coordinates stored as long / lat, not lat / long
- Confirmed geolocation data with google maps; location markers plotting correctly
